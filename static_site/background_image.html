<h1>Background image</h1>
<p>
For a short explanation of .bround, the image wins outwrite!
Fuller explanation below:
For .bround, The background colour (in the shorthand code above) puts the image first, then the background colour.So even when the colour has an opaque of 1, you still don't see it. You still just see the image.
</p>

<p>Above is shorthand and below is probably tidier, although the results are just the same. Image wins.<br/>
.bround {
  background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 1); /* Fully opaque green */
  background-image: url('images/image2.jpg');
  background-size: 100%;
}
