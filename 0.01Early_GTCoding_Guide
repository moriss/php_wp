Updating from February 22

Initial Notes:
The new boston might be the guy that taught me building a wordpress OR Joomla template before. You could also refer to his tutorials.

So you have 2 wordpress folders. one you created yourself at: 
desktop>projects>wordpress   Ths is the one you are using for the start of the course. 


and the downloaded one at: other locations>computer>opt>lampp>htdocs>wordpress
You will migrate to this one when you start with php.


Opening xampp 
In order to begin working with php locally, you need to open xampp inside of htdocs. You have been doing this for the early part of the gtcoding course.  
sudo ./manager-linux-x64.run

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KibbYf9avko&t=43s
1.22 IS START OF PHP INTRODUCTION. 
**iMPORTANT NOTE:You have a php_intro folder in opt/lampp/htdocs
withins this is an index.php file. You can only make changes/additions to this folder if you access it via su superuser via terminal.(instructioins on how to do this is in the ubuntu folder and also here). 

sudo su
Type above into terminal and enter your password. this gives you superuser rights so you can open, edit and save files inside htdocs. 



Instructions on how to do create, edit and save files in htdocs


RUN XAMPP FIRST, THEN PASTE http://localhost/php_intro
INTO YOUR GOOGLE BROWSER TO GET TO THE PHP PAGE YOU ARE WORKING ON. (index.php)

Then open the file in an editable version:
Remember you need to open the file via terminal as a superuser (bluefish <filename> ) in order to make changes/additions and save the file.


SO FAR
I am starting from the beginning of the tutorial using the index.php file in htdocs/php_intro
