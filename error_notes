Generaly speaking, actions requre {} braces whilst conditions require () braces.
{  ;}   and (  );
Do this {  ;}  while (this is true) ;
Please note position of semi colon being inside for {} and outside for ()

Where you combine greater than and equal to operators, you need to NOT have spaces in between.
Example

for($i = 0; $i <= $limit; $i++) This is ok
for($i = 0; $i < = $limit; $i++) The space between < and = causes as parsing error.

Associative array.
This took me a while to figure out. Make sure you have a comma between key-value pairs.
<?php 
$tifl = array("first" =>"green" , "second" =>"blue" , "third"=>"purple");
echo ($tifl["first"]);
?>


There is a difference between writing an array (use curly brackets) and accessing a specific array index (use square brackets).
$nen = array("blue", "Green", "yello");
echo $nen[2];
