# php
This repo is initially based on the wordpress/php tutorial on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KibbYf9avko&t=43s

I'm using it as a way to introduce myself to wordpress templates whilst dabbling in more into php

The file named 'local' shows instructions on how to add a wordpress site to the downloaded local software. 
Local is an alternative to using xampp to insall wordpress. I'm using local in this instance because the course above does. (A file in the Ubuntu repo shows you how to download software onto the ubuntu linux platform)
