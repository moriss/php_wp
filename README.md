# php
This repo is initially based on the wordpress/php tutorial on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KibbYf9avko&t=43s  aka GTCoding

I'm using it as a way to introduce myself to wordpress templates whilst dabbling more into php

The file named 'local' shows instructions on how to add a wordpress site to the downloaded local software. 
Local is an alternative to using xampp to insall wordpress. I'm using local in this instance because the course above does. (A file in the Ubuntu repo shows you how to download software onto the ubuntu linux platform)

During the early stages of this course I used xampp to practice general php exercises and created code files along the way for reference.

0.01Early GTCoding guide: Contains general notes as I worked my way through the initial stages of the course up to the php exercises.
