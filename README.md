This repo is initially based on the wordpress/php tutorial on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KibbYf9avko&t=43s  aka GTCoding

I'm using it as a way to introduce myself to wordpress templates whilst dabbling more into php

7th December 2022
I am working through the course mainly using and updating the 0.2Custom_Theme_WP  file.
I am 2.16 into the course.

If you have been away from this course for a time, It may be best to re-start earlier on where 'Local' is introduced, just to familiarise yourself with what you have been doing leading up to adding your own theme. 

The file named 'local' shows instructions on how to add a wordpress site to the downloaded local software. 

Local is an alternative to using xampp to insall wordpress. I'm using local in this instance because the course above does. (A file in the Ubuntu repo shows you how to download software onto the ubuntu linux platform)

Early Part of the Course:
During the early stages of this course I used xampp to practice general php exercises and created code files along the way for reference. If you have been away from this course for a while, you should go over the php code in the two following files:

0.01Early_GTCoding_Guide: Contains general notes as I worked my way through the initial stages of the course up to the php exercises.

0.02Early_GTCoding_Practice:  Contains alot of introductory php code for your reference

A note to myself. 
I have various files in blue laptop>projects>wordpress   and   htdocs  that are relevant to this course. Particularly dashboard.php which deals with forms.
I don't really need them at the moment moving forward since I am now using 'local' to run wordpress (locally) to ultimately create my own wordpress theme. So everything relating to this course, from now on, can be found on this repo. Although this is open to change/correction where I am free to delve back into past work anywhewre I see fit.
