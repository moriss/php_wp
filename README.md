You have made some updates to make it easier to find resources. You decided the most important thing is to make it as easy as possible to self learn effectively rather than trying to create a resource for others. 

So you have blue/desktop/AAll for code you can grab as you build a site and All_wp_0624 to work throught the static element of the wordpress course. 

You have created a 'static_site' directory in your php_wp repo to begin analysing the html, css and javascript portion in blue/Desktop/projects/wordpress/my wp website 0624.

Below can be checked at a later date but above is enough to be getting on with. 

This is the gtcoding tutorial.

Quick Setup: 

Where you are just now is your own php_wp git repo in htdocs. It needs to be in htdocs so you can run xampp for the php code you will be using. 
Instructions on how to start xampp are in start/xampp_run

As you work through the course using the notes and referencing the video :
You have 3 wordpress folders. 
1. One you created yourself at:
desktop/projects/wordpress
This is the one you are using for the start of the course for html/css and javascript.
The desktop/projects/wordpress/my_website_0624 is the version that has the locally installed google fonts and font awsome so you can work on it offline.


2. The official downloaded one at: other locations>computer>opt>lampp>htdocs>wordpress
You will migrate to this one when you start with php.

3.php_wp repo in htdocs: This is the actual repo used for the course. Here you can organise your notes better and play around with php.

I'm starting back at
0.01Early_GTCoding_Guide
to familiarise myself with the beginning of the course.

You are currently starting from the static site and in particular, trying to better understand the html and css. You also want to work with the static sight locally so you have created three files giving instructtions on how to use fontawsome locally, remotely and a third file shows you how to use google fonts both remotely and locally. These files are in google drive/AAAcoding. You have also moved this repo to the htdocs directory which means you can use xampp for php so you don't need to donwload local (and use up even more memory).


Files you are working on for above are in blue/Projects/Wordpress/my wp website 0624.

Below here are important notes especially if you have been away from this for a while. It contains information about working through this repo. 

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@


Go straight to 0.2Custom_Theme_WP to work your way through the youtube course below. 0.2Custom_Theme_WP is a comprehensive guide that also refers to other files within this repo as you put your wordpress site together. You also have written material to run alongside these files.

This repo is initially based on the wordpress/php tutorial on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KibbYf9avko&t=43s  aka GTCoding
If you click on 'show more' under the video it gives you all the time-lines for each area of the course. Very handy!
The video comes from freeCodeCamp.org

##Update 24th January 23
This other guy seems to cover alot with wordpress and introduced me to using a child site to add font awsome icons.
His videos could be very useful. Below is one of them.

Read below if you have been away from this for while.

I'm using it as a way to introduce myself to wordpress templates whilst dabbling more into php

The main goals are to get familiar with building wordpress themes easily and then get comfortable making user-side updates etc so I can show potential customers how to get the most from their wordpress site. 

7th December 2022
I am working through the course mainly using and updating the 0.2Custom_Theme_WP  file.
I am 2.16 into the course.

If you have been away from this course for a time, It may be best to re-start earlier on where 'Local' (0.1_Local_WP) is introduced, around 1.58 in, just to familiarise yourself with what you have been doing leading up to adding your own theme. 

Local is an alternative to using xampp to insall wordpress. I'm using local in this instance because the course above does. (A file in the Ubuntu repo shows you how to download software onto the ubuntu linux platform)

Early Part of the Course:
During the early stages of this course I used xampp to practice general php exercises and created code files along the way for reference. If you have been away from this course for a while, you should go over the php code in the two following files:

0.01Early_GTCoding_Guide: Contains general notes as I worked my way through the initial stages of the course up to the php exercises.

0.02Early_GTCoding_Practice:  Contains alot of introductory php code for your reference

A note to myself. 
I have various files in blue laptop>projects>wordpress   and   htdocs  that are relevant to this course. Particularly dashboard.php which deals with forms.
I don't really need them at the moment moving forward since I am now using 'local' to run wordpress (locally) to ultimately create my own wordpress theme. So everything relating to this course, from now on, can be found on this repo. Although this is open to change/correction where I am free to delve back into past work anywhewre I see fit.
